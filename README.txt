A Django project template. The project uses fab, virtualenv, supervisord to manage processes and dependencies in a self-contained manner and contains stub Nginx and supervisor config for staging and production releases.

Usage:
Replace all instances of 'django-template' with your project name.
Rename directories accordingly.

Have fun!
